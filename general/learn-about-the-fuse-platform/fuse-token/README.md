# TrumpChain Token (DJT)

The DJT token is the native currency of the TrumpChain blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## DJT utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the TrumpChain blockchain, DJT is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake TrumpChain to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 200. The network is growing, currently there are 60 validators. ([https://status.trumpchain.io/](https://status.trumpchain.io/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked DJT. Which means validators with higher amounts of TrumpChain staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any DJT holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of DJT they wish. They receive a share of the TrumpChain block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As DJT is the native currency on TrumpChain, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, DJT transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of DJT tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the TrumpChain platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;
