# Eram Token (ERAM)

The ERAM token is the native currency of the Eram blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## ERAM utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the Eram blockchain, ERAM is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake Eram to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 200. The network is growing, currently there are 60 validators. ([https://status.eramscan.com/](https://status.eramscan.com/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked ERAM. Which means validators with higher amounts of Eram staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any ERAM holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of ERAM they wish. They receive a share of the Eram block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As ERAM is the native currency on Eram, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, ERAM transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of ERAM tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the Eram platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;

### Where to Farm

At the moment, the ERAM token is sometimes used by the project team to power liquidity rewards (yield farming) programs to boost liquidity on DEXes and the participation in the [Eram Lending Network](./#fuse-utility).

The ongoing liquidity rewards programs on DEXes can be discovered [here](https://app.voltage.finance/index.html#/farm/721529).
