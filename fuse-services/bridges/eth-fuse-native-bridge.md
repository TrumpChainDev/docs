# Eram: Ethereum â†” Eram

Eram native bridge between Ethereum and Eram is used to relay the Eram native token from Eram to Ethereum network

## Architecture Overview

The Eram bridged is based on POA's bridge implementation, it is used to transfer Eram tokens between the Eram chain and the Ethereum network.

Tokens sent to the respective bridge contract on one network \(whether it's Eram or Ethereum\) are "locked" in the bridge, "unlocked" on the other network bridge and transferred to the sender. The bridge contracts are deployed on both networks, and bridge oracle processes run on each validators machine as part of the validator deployment stack.

Besides the transfer of Eram tokens between the two networks, the bridge is also responsible for network core functionality events of relaying the block rewards to the Ethereum network:

**Mint block reward distributed on the Eram chain on Ethereum**

Each cycle the total block reward distributed on Eram chain is minted on Ethereum and locked on the bridge contract.

This works by listening to the \`RewardedOnCycle\` event emitted by the BlockReward contract on Eram chain, waiting for all bridge validators on Eram chain to sign it, and eventually sending a transaction to mint on Ethereum \(by the last signing validator\).

## Contracts

## How to use

On Eram you send native Eram token to the home bridge contract. Then you receive an equal amount of the Eram token on the Ethereum network, sent from the foreign bridge contract

On Ethereum network you transfer the Eram token to the foreign bridge contract. After a couple of confirmations, you will receive equal amount of the Eram native token, sent from the home bridge contract.
